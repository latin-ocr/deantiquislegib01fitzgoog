P. clxxxvi-Note. The mention in this grant 01 John Lord Bardoll to
the priory 01 Shouldham, 01 Margaret, widow 01 Guy de Montfort, 01
Beaudcsert, com. Warwiclr, daughter 01 Thomas Beauchamp‚ Earl 01 War-
wiclr‚ and 01 Catharine, daughter 01 Guy de Warwielr, eldest son 011110
Earl of Warwiclr‚ deceased, aeth April, 25 Ε118.111. 1351, together with
his own sister, Elisabeth, 1801 118011 indicative 01 8 near degree 01 kindred

between the parties ; aud hence it may be assumed, as 88 unquestionable
fact, that Agnes, his mother, wife 01 Thomas Lord Bardolf, was the seventh
daughter 01 Thomas Beauchamp‚ Earl 01 Warwiclr, and that Margaret was
the aunt and Catharine the cousin-german 01 the grantor. According 1ο
the pedigree 01 this family, compiled by John Rous, this carl had a daughter,
Agnes, who is described 10 have been the wife 01. . . . . Colresey, andafter·
wards of ..... Bardolf. Dugdale 18101188 88 that he had nine daughters,
whose portraitures were curicusly drawn, and placed in the windows on the
south side 01 the quire 01 the collegiata church in Warwick, and in the
habit 01 that time. Seven 01 them were married, aud had their paternal
arms upon their inner garments, and 08 their outer mantle their husband'a
arms. The same writer has also given an engraving 01 these nine daughters
80 painted, and to each 18 8 label with their names. Thus the one labelled
Margareta has on her gown, “ Gulae, crusilly and a fess or,'' the arms 01
Beauchamp,and 08 her mantle, “ Bendy or and azure,'' the arms 01 Μο811011;
and the seventh daughter, labelled Agneta, has the same arms on her gown,
and 08 her martie, “ Azure, scmee 01 cinquefoils or,” the arms 01 Bardolf.
The eroes-crosslcts 810 801 limited 10 six, but spread all over the gowne, and
mantle also in respect 01 doliana, the ninth daughter, who died unmarried. 111
like manner the cinqucfoils are 801 limited 10 three, as usually borne by the
family 01 Bardolf. Elizabcth, another daughter, 18 twicc pourtrayed aa Isa-
bella and Elizabeth‚and having in each instance on her mantle, “ Sable,a crosa
engrailed or,'' the arms 01 Ufford, Earl 01 Sullolk, which repetition Dugdale
explains as being descriptive 01 her first marriage with John Lord Strange
01 Blackmerc, com. Salop. Hence we may infer that Agnes was the wife,
first, 01 Thomas Lord Bardolf, whose oldest son John was bom 13111188.
1312;8811 that after his decease, on thc loth day 01 Feb. 2Edw. 111.
1328, she rc·married Sir Walter dc Cokesey‚ of Cokesey, 001811010. whose

son and heir, Sir Walter Cokesey‚ was executor of Sir ll'illiam Tmssell, 01
