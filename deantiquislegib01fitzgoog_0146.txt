depuis. Et que notre dit Sire le lloy ait auxi la forfaiture de touta les
biens et chatcux, queux fiuent as dits Henry de Percy et Thomas Bardolf,
ou l'autre d’eux, le dit sisme jour de May, ou depuis.” ln the following
year a servant of Lord Bardolf‚ named John, was taken with letters, and
amested and committed in charge to the Lord de Grey, in whose custody
he remained from the 6th day of J uly up to the aoth day of February, for
230 days. In this interval of time, early in the year 1408, the Earl and
Lord Bardolf, deceived by false intelligenoe, entered Northumberland, and,
having been joined by several of the adherents of the Earl, advanced
forward into Yorlrshire. At Thirslr they published a manifesto containing
the reason of their being in arms, and at Knaresborough were joined by
Sir Nicholas Tempest, whence they continued their route through Wetherby,
over Bramham Moor, in the direction of Haalewood, where they were en-
couutered by the forces under the command of sir Thomas Rolreby, sheriff
of Yorkshire, whom they had supposed to be friendly to their cause! On
the field of battle, fought on the l9th day of February, Sunday next after
the feast of St. Valentine, the Earl of Northumberland was alain, and Lord
Bardolf so severely wounded that he expired bcforc the miduight bour had
passed, a prisoner in the hands of the victors. According to the sentence
above recorded, the heads of these noblemen were severed from their bodies,

and the remaining porticus of the headless tmnlrs divided into four parts.
On the Close Roll of the 9th year of Henry IV., under the heading “ De

capitibus et quarteriis Henrici Percy, nuper comitis Northumbrie, et
domini de Bardolf, super pontem londoniarum ponendiS,'’ we read aa
follows :-

* This is the oecount furnisbed by the Scotichronicon of Fordun‚ who was apparently
abeliaver in the report that Richard tha Second was alive and then a fugitive in Scotlsnd,
as he declares that many from England in those days flod from the court of Henry tha
rourth and came into Scotland to lling Richard, ond among them Henry Perry the elder,
with his grandson Henry the younger, the Lord Bardolf, and two Welsh bishops-
namely, Griffin Bishop of Baugor, and David Biahop of St. Araph, and the Abbot of
Welbcclr. Hs also dasenbes Sir Thomas Bokeby erroneously aa a certain Richard Rulrby,
a vassal of the Earl of Northumberlsnd, and hence a certain degree of discredit attachea
to his story of the enterprise having been prompted hy his treacherous olrice. It is
abaurd to suppose that lling llenry lV. would bave appointed any of the liegrmen of the
Earl of Nortbumbsrlsnd to tha post of sherifl, whose treason datad from sn earlier period
than the year bs was in office.
