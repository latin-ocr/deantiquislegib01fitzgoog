The jurors on the inquisition taken at Croyd0n‚ eom. Surrey, ou the last
day of August, l7th Edw. ll„ found that she had held the manor of
Adyngton, in the aforesaid county, for the term 01 her life only, by the

the lord the King, and that after the decease of the said lsabella it was to

duced before the jurors‚ who supposing that the entail had taken effect, they
falsely describe this elder brother, Thomas Bardolf, 10 bave died without
issue, aud that william Bardolf, his brother, left a son of the name 01
Thomas Bardolf, who was the common ancestor‚ at variance with the find·
