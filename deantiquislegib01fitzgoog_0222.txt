present Acte had never be made.”

By virtue of this Act the King, by lettere Patent, dated 11th of Decem·
ber following, granted to John de Vere, Earl of Oxford‚ the custody of the
person os William Viscount Beaumont, and of hie eaid lirelihood and inher-
itanoe. From these prooeedings we are made acquainted with the fact that
the mind of thie nobleman had given way under the sudden overjoy of his
restoration to his name, dignity and inheritance; and that it had eventually
become necessary, after first incapacitating him from having the rule of his
estate, to appointa committee of his person. Thia appointment of John
Earl of Oxford to be hie guardian was the occasion of his removal to the
mmor-house of the Earls of Oxford‚ at wivenhoe‚· in the county of
Essex; and in the church of that parish, dedicated to St. Mmy, he was
interred. He died in the reventieth year of hie age, on the l9th day ot⁴
December, 23 Heu. Vll. 1507, without issue, aa we leam from this
inscription on hie tomb in the chanoel of the church above named: “Here
in the erthe, undyr thys Marhull, Reet the bonys of the Nohle Lorde

Wylliam Beanmount, Knyght, Viscount Beaumont, and Lorde Bardolfe.

0 Norden, in his Deseription oi Essex, mentions “ Wyvenhoo Hali, deosyde. A Μ]
bowse3 sometyme E. oi Oxiord.” The familias oi Beaumont and Vere were nearly

related through the marriage oi Henry finh Lord Beanmont with Margaret, daughter n!
John de Vere, seventh Earl oi Oxrord. ln the east window oi the church ol Benen-

upon·llnmber is still remaining a portraiture of this nobleman in painted glan ; and
beneath was this tetrasticlr ι

“ Rex Hierosolymus cum Bellomonte looatur,
Bellusmons iterum curn Boghsn consociatum

Belluemone iterum cum longicastro religatur,
Belluemons [sponsalibus] Oronie titulatur.”

The word between brackets wanting in the original, thus supplied by Mr. Sego, was
doubtless a third repetition oi the word “iterum'’
