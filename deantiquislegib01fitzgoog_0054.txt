was made 1)] the jurors 01 the hundred 01 Paling‚ in the rape 01 Arrmdel,
who declared that the men of Robert Aguylon had been captured, with their
dogs, upon the liberty 01 the Bishop 01 Chichester at Henfield‚ by John de
Boua, and had been incarcerated 1)] the 00100, namely, in the Castle 01
Lewes‚ and thereupon the King’s writ had been obtained for their deliver-
anne, and the keeper of the castle aforesaid had denied and refused 10 deliver
the said prisoners 10 the officere 01 the Sheriff by a precept 01 this kind,
until the Sheriff came in his own person. On the other hand, the jurors 01
the hundred 01 Avist'ord brought iu verdicts ior misdemeanours against
Richard de Niton and John de Pollingieud, successively bailiffs 01 the li·
berty 01 Arundcl by appointment of Robert Aguylun3 and the jurors of tho
burgh 01 Arundel declared that the then Sheriff came with the King’s brief
on the eve 01 All Saiuts, 10 receive the Castle 01 Arnndel by virtue of the
same briei 00 bebalt' of the King‚ and that John de Pollingfeud detained
the said castle‚ and still detains it, in contempt 01 the King. From a peti-
tion 10 Parliament in the 611) year of Edward 1., addressed by Robert
Aguylun 10110 King and his Council, we leam that, whereas Stephon de
Peucestre and Robert (10 Sandwich had been appointed justioes 10 inquire,
hear, and detennine, according 10 the law and custom 01 the resim, what
malefactors had hunted in the free-warren and chace 01 11ιο Earl 01 Warren3
and he, Robert, and others were indicted therefore, and the justioas sent to
the Sheriff to seiae the persons 01 Robert Aguylon and the others, and to
place their lands and castles in the King’s hands, and this on the first day
01 the inquest, and that he bring their bodies 10 Kingstou‚ in a different
county; 00 which day those attached put in essoigns, which the justices
would 001 allow, but amerced their mainpernors, at their will, against the
costum 01 the realm ;and besides, though their letters patent only gave thern
power to inquire as 10 the free chase and the injuries done to the men 01 the
Earl, they, beyond their authority, iuquired and made him answer as 10 the
chades, without inquiry 01 the Earl 01 Warren 11 1ιο had free chace there or
not; notwithstanding that he, Robert Aguylun, was ready 10 aver that his
people had not hunted save where hc and his ancestors were accustomed to
hunt, and 01 right ought to hunt, the judges refused to receive the averment,
and charged the jury to his grievance, 01 which he prays remedy and 01 1110
imprisonment he prays remedy‚ 01 him aud 01 his people‚ who are still in
prison, as it seems to him that imprisonment does not lie in this case.
