day oi June last past, whence, the same day, with Sir Thomas Broughton, knight‚ and
others, to the number oi 8000 men, in hostile manner he passed on continually from
place to place nntil he come ιο Stoke in the county oi Nottingham‚ where, the ltlth day
oi June last past, he leried war against the person oi his Sorereign and natural liege Inrd,
and garcio him mighty and strong battle. Throughout this Act there isno mention ol
Francis Visoount Lovell, who was apparently leit out by reason that he had been already
attainted in the Parliament holden at westminster, 'r' Nor. 1 Henry Vll. 1485, as one oi

unncceoeary, and its sole object appears, in making such false allegatione, to have been tc
find some pretext ior barring his heirs from elaiming any inheritance, which would here

revened to him, hed he been alive.
