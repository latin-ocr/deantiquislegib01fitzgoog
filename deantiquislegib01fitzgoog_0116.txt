PREPACE. CXV

· The public services of John Lord Bardolf are detailed by Dugdale in his
Baranage, who, after noticing that he was on the King's service beyond
sea in 37 Edw. lll. adds; “but this is all that l have seen of him till his
death, which hapued 3 Aug. 45 E. lll.’' This observation clearly proves
that the record he cites, Esc. 45 Edw. lll. n. 7, had never been pemsed by
this writer, and is in direct contradiction to his next paragraph, which con·

xiv years of age, whose wardship and marriage was granted by Queen
Philippa (wife to King Edward the Third) in 40 Edw. Ill. unto Sir
Michael Poynings, Knight, to the intent that he should marry Agnes,
daughter of the said Michael (Pat. 40 Edw. lll. p. l, m. 37); which
ll'illiam, upon proof of his age and doing his homage in 45 Edw. 111. had
livery cf his lauds. (ltot (laus. 45 Edw. Ill. m. 14.)·' This confusion of
dates arose from the inquisition post mortem having been calendered as of
the 45 Edw. ΙΙΙ. ιι. 7, the date of a writ for fresh inquiry, instead of the
right date of the writ of diem clausit extremum, addressed to liegarde
Wolforton‚ the King's escheator in the connties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex,
and Hertford, which has the King's teste at westminster, lssth day of
October, 37th year of his reign, 1:363. Pursnant to this writ an inquisition
was talen at Woodbridge, com. suff. leth day of December following, on
which the finding of the jurors iras to this effect, that John Bardolf of

the third day of August last past, and that ll'illiam, his son, is next heir of
the same John, and of the age of fourtecn years and eleven weelrs. Of
previous date an inquisition was taken at Fyncham, com. Norf. 14th day
