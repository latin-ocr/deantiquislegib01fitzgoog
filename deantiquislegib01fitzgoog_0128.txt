' The manor of Brattelby, in the hundred of hanins, parts of Liudsey, Lincolushire,

Robert de Halo, the owner of Fillingham, and was apparently considered as tho eaput of this

to the orown after the decease of Alica do Lacy, the widow of Thomas Earl of Leucastcr,
in 1348 ; but the statement of the jury that it aas held of Thomas Esrl of chester is
apparently enonaous, unless a son of that name had been born of Anne of &hemia the
first wife of Richard the Second, who died an infant suhsequeut to this date, and before
the time of its ereetion into o Principality, which was heroafter, according to an Act of
Padiamentflst Rie. 11. to servo as the appanage of the futuro heir apparent to the throne,
if God should grant tha Kiag this blessing.
