01 Robert Aguilon to his father Williarn Agoilon‚ that eminent genealogist,
Dugdsle, writes as follows ι “ Το this William succeeded another Willinm,
who, in 42 Hen. 111., received command to attend the King on Mondny
next preceding the feast 01 St. John Baptist, well fitted with horse and arms,
to restrain the incursions 01 the Welch,” citing ·‘ Clsus, 42 Heu. 111. in dorso,
m. 11.” This entry is found on Rot. Claus. 44 Hen. 111. m. li, in dorso,
and regards Robert Aguilon, who held his msnor 01 Watton-at·Stone by
this service; nor is the error corrected, where other records are cited, but
every act 01 Robert is ascribed to a second Wiiiiam Aguilon, and even the
inquisition post mortem upon Robert Aguilon is ascribed to this imaginsry
Bnron. In like manner, in his biography 01 his father, the same writer,
after copying Matthew Paris, adds, ‘⁴ Whereupon the King caused ali his
lsnds to be seizcd and given to Simon de Campo-Remigio, quoting Claus.
17 Joh. m. 6. 5. On membrane 6 the name 01 Aguilun does not occur,
but on membrane 5 we read, “Mandatum est vicecomitibus Norfolcie et
Sutiolcie ‘et Essexie‚' quod facient habere Simoni de Campo Remigii totam
terram que fuit Roberti Aguillun cum pertinentiis in balliva sua, quarn do-
minus Rex ei concessit. Apud Storteford xxx die Marcii.” This entry
bas reference to a Robert Aguillon, son 01 Willism Aguillun, who had
married Agatha, one 01 the daughters and coheiresses 01 Fulk de Beaufou,
Lord 01 Hokewoid and East Herling, com. Norfolk, and 01 Debenham in
Suffolln andos Borley in Esses. His heirs were four daughters. Agathe,
Isabells, Johanns, and Margeria, 01 whom Adam de Kokefield, Lucas de
Poynings‚ Ralph hitz Bernard, and Andrew de Sakevill, were respectively
the heirs, as appears by a pleading 01 “Quare impedit' for the sdvowson
01 the church 01 Hokewold, 01 Hillnry Term, 7 Edw. 111. 1334.

In or before the year 1257, 41 Hen. 111. Robert Aguilon married Joan
de Mohun, one 01 the seven daughters 01 Willinm de Ferrsrs‚ Earl 01 Derby,
who succeeded to thst title upon the decease 01 his father, 221 September
