inquisition was taken at Lewos on the last day but one of the month of
February, before John Broke, escheator of Surrey and Sussex, on which the
finding of tho jurors was to this effect ; that William Bardolf of Wermegay‚
chevaler, held nothing in chief of the lord the King in the county of
Sussex, but that he held the manor of Portslade of Richard Earl of
Amndel and Surrey, which manor the Lord La Warre had held of the
said William by military service, and that the said William held it of the
aforesaid Earl by the service of ten knight's fees, which services were
worth nothing, except after the decease of the tenant of the aforesaid manor‚
