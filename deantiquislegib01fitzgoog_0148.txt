nineteen and more, and the aforesaid Jcan‚ aged eighteen and more, were his
daughters and next beirs; value of the manor 2015, and no other lands held

Seturday next aster the feast of All Saints, 10 Hen. lv. ard Now, before
Robert Oxenbrugge, King’s escheator in Sussex, on which the several
tenuras of the mauors of Barcomb and Plumpton are deduoed in like
manner, setting forth the fines and charters under which they were
respectively held by tbe deceased, and the names and ages of the heire as
above, which manera were held of Thomas Earl of Arundel, as of the
barony of Lewes, by military service, both being worth forty marks
yearly. A third was taken at Oxford, on the lst Oct, 10 Henry lv.
before Robert James, the escheator of that county, as to the maner of
Holton, which was acquired under the grant of King Edward ΙΙ., and
which had been held by the deceased of the Prince of wales, as of the
honour cf St. Valery‚ by the service of a rent of one penny yearly, and

Leia, was taken on Thursday next before the feast of St. Michael, 27th
Sept, 9 Heu. IV. before Alvered Trussell‚ the King's escheator, on which
we bave this finding: “dicunt super sacramentum suurn quod Dominus
hienricus, nuper Rex Anglie, Dux Normannie et Aquitanie et Comes

nuper Regis et sibi remansit donanda per judicium curie sue.” From
these parties, who held this maner by virtue of this gift, the pedigree is
dedueed as in the former inquisitione, and its velue put down at fifteen
marks. ln like manner, upon the inquisition taken ct Shelford on Monday
next after the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Crosa, 17th Sept. 1408,
before llobert Twyford‚ escheator of the county of Nottingham, King

Henry the Second is stated to have given the mauors of Shelford end
Stokebardolf to the same ancestor of the deceased, and from him the

stands printed in the lpodIgma Naustriae of Walsingham, which error has been blindly
followed by every modern writer, and doubtless arose from a misconeeption that the
Arabio number 11 was the Roman numeral 11.
