late her husband, for the term 01 the life of the same Agnes also of a fee-
farm rent from Berwick and Wyngeton‚ worth yearly 1311. 160411. Also
that 110 said Thomas lllortemer had taken all the issnes and profits of 110
above from the time 01 his forfaiture up to the day of the sentence pro·
nounced against him in the Parliament last past, and that the reversione of
the above after the death of the aforesaid Agnes were belonging to Sir
Thermas Bnrdolf of Werrncgay, chivolcr, son and heir of the aforesaid Wil-
liam Bardolf. As on the day of the mecting of the Parliament, Sir Thomas
Mortemer, whose appearance had been required by briefs sent by 11100100-
00110101 England, directed to lloger Mortemer, Εο1101 March, the King’s
licutenant in lreland, or to his depnty, as well as to every sheriff of England,
which also enjoined them to seiae his person, wherever he might bc, came not
nor surrendered himself pursuant to these commende, he was adjudged to he
a traitor, and convicted of all the treasons which the appellante had laid 10
his charge, and all his possessione, which had been belonging 10 him on the
said 13111 day 01 November, ll 1110. 11. 1387, 01 01000, were declared to
be forfeited to the King. All the proceedings in this Parliament were
annulled in the first Parliament of the reign 01 Henry IV. held at West·
minster 00 Monday 1110 feast of St. Faith the Virgin, 6 001. 1399, and all
those forejndged restored to their names and inheritances, or their heirs, if
deceased in the interval. 11 10 doubtful if Sir Thomas Mortemer survived
10 that time, nor has his lineage been satisfactorily developed3 bnt our
knowledge that the place of his retreat was lreland, and thet prior 10 110
impeachment he had beena leader of the rebels congregated in the highlands
01 that island, renders it probable that he was of near affinity 10 the Earl of
March, who, by marriage with the heiress 01 the Earls of Ulster, had large
estates 10 Ulster and Connanght. Prior to the 911 Jannary, 4 llen. lV. 1403,
he was deceased, as the will of Agnes Lady Bardolf, widow 01 811 Thomas
Mortimer, is of that date, and made duringa residenoe in the dwelling·house
of Richard de Vere, Earl of Oxford, thena minor, in the parish of St. Augus·
tine-Papey, in the city of Loudon. One of its provisions directe her body
10 10 buried in the priory of the lIoly Trinitywithout Aldgate, and another
contains an appointment 01 Henry Earl 01 Northnmberlund,and 01 101 000
Thomas Lord Bardolf, to be supervisors of the same, thus affording the

earliest evidence 01 the intimacy 01 that illustrious nobleman with her
