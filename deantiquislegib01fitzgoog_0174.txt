On the seventh day aster the dats of this codicil, the sixth day of June,

lllth Heu. v1., the testator died, and Henry Chicheley, Archbishop of
Canterbury, granted probate of this will aud codicil, by his letter, bearing
data at his monor oi Croydou, on the 28th day of the same mouth, being
in tho esth year of his translation to that see, addressed to William
Goffchin, in decretis Baeculam-ius, appointing him his proctor. Upon the
receipt of this letteren the second of July‚ the proctor repaired to Sullolk,
and administration of the effecte was granted to dean, Lady Bardolll‚ Wil-
liam Goode esquire, John Puttolr‚ and Richard Palmer cleric, the two
others having renounced‚ on the eighth day oi July‚ in the church of Den-
hington.

Availiug themselves of the proviso in the codicil, the executore did not
comply with the humble request of the testator to be buried in the cerne·
tcry of the church of Dennington‚ and he yet lies entombed with his wife
nuder a square obloug monument, ornamented with gothic traoery, on
which are the effigies of both in alabaster, richly painted sud gilded, eight
feet in length and four in breadth‚ in the chapel of St. Margaret, on the
south side of the church of St. Mary of Dennington. A drawing alter the
tomb was made by Joshua Kirby, and published by him March 25, 1748,
having been engraved by J. Wood; which plate is inscribed to Sir John
Rouso, Baronet. subsequently drawings of the same effigies were made
by C. Α. Stothard, one of which was etched by him, aud the other by
C. J. Smith‚ and now constitute the plates 110 and lll in the Monumental
Effigies of Great Britain, folio, London, 1817, where they are erroneously
supposed to be those of Sir Robert Grushill and his lady, in Hoveringham
church, Notts, as is observed in the accompanying description, and which
error has been rectified by the publishers in a communication inserted in
the Gentlemau’s Magazine. The first of these platos is afront view of
both effigies, and the second a profile view of Lord Bardolf, with details
representing one extremity of the collar of S.S., and the centre of the
girdle‚ and the letters 1.H.s. ou the bacinet. Lord Bardolf is represented
in full ormont, save the visor, his head resting on his helmet with

19th Heu. Vl„ 1441, the year ol the decom ol the testator. And hence the discrepsncy
iu describing John Lord Beuumontss ι viseount before hia ereation to the title, it the
codicil had been dated 8th July‚ 1139, m it sunda printed in his Barnnsge, vol. ii.
